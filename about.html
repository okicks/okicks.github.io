                <h2 class="text-center">History</h2>

                <br>

                <p class="text-center">I was born in England and moved to the US when I was the age of 10. I entered the American school system on the last day of the fourth grade. I always had an affinity with electonics and loved them, but it was when I entered eighth grade I took my first, very basic, software development course. I was hooked.</p>

                <p class="text-center">I took all the IT and software courses I could in high school. Winding up in an AP Computer Science course learning Java (my first proper progamming language). I excelled in that course. The following year I was allowed in a independant study programming course. I was one of four students that were allowed in that year. I completed my first real project, a basic instant messaging client and server that worked over the internet (all in Java). I also took a web development course at the same time, but nothing too remarkable came of it.</p>

                <p class="text-center">Once I left high school, I went to IUPUI for Computer Science. I loved my classes, quickly learning Python, but unfortunately I fell ill, and had to drop out. I was told that I would be always welcome back and that I was "the exact student [they're] looking for". While I was out of offical schooling, I did mini projects for myself, that just helped me with my everyday use of my computer. Once I was feeling better, I decided to enroll in Ivy Tech Community College in Software Development. I excelled in all my classes and made the Dean's List multiple times. I was teaching to my classmates, not just software, but algebra too. Ivy Tech hired me as a student tutor to help teach algebra. I made a couple of scripts for Microsoft Excel, a couple of simple programs, and even a basic website, just for my job. They never got picked up by my coworkers, but my boss was impressed. This was on top of the database courses, Android app writing courses, website building course, and the building a software project courses. Unfortunately, I fell ill once again, and was forced to drop out, even though I was close to graduating.</p>
